A Philosophical Note on Systemic Admissibility
Motivation
Across scientific, technical, and social domains, systems often fail not because local rules are violated, but because global proportionality constraints are exceeded. Such failures manifest as instabilities, inefficiencies, pathological behaviors, or apparent paradoxes. These phenomena recur across physics, biology, cognition, artificial intelligence, economics, and governance, yet are typically analyzed within siloed, domain-specific frameworks.
The concept of Systemic Admissibility is introduced to address this gap—not by proposing a new operational theory, but by providing a meta-level criterion for interpreting when systems can persist under constraint.
Epistemic Position
Systemic Admissibility is not:
a predictive or executable model,
an optimization objective,
a new physical or biological law,
a substitute for domain-specific theories.
Instead, it is a conceptual admissibility condition: a necessary (but not sufficient) criterion for systemic viability. It operates at the level of interpretation and diagnosis, not intervention or control.
The framework formalizes a minimal proportionality relation between:
Value or functional outcome, and
the combined energetic, informational, and structural costs required to sustain that outcome.
When proportionality is preserved, systems remain viable. When it is violated, breakdowns emerge.
Relation to Existing Scientific Principles
Systemic Admissibility is analogous in epistemic role—not in content—to:
conservation principles in physics,
bounded rationality in cognitive science,
feasibility constraints in optimization theory,
stability conditions in dynamical systems.
Like these principles, it does not specify what happens, but constrains what can coherently persist. Importantly, boundary violations are not treated as errors, but as signals of regime transitions—points at which prior models lose validity.
The Role of the Atlas
The Systemic Admissibility Atlas complements the canonical framework by documenting:
recurring admissibility failure patterns,
boundary conditions and thresholds,
cross-domain analogies between breakdown phenomena,
qualitative regime-shift signatures.
The Atlas does not define admissibility. It illustrates how admissibility constraints manifest across domains. It is interpretive, comparative, and diagnostic in nature.
Intended Use
This work is intended to:
support cross-disciplinary reasoning,
provide a shared conceptual language for boundary problems,
help distinguish local model failures from global admissibility violations,
remain conservative in claims to preserve epistemic clarity.
It is offered as a meta-analytic lens, open to critique, refinement, and disciplined extension.
