# Systemic Admissibility Atlas

The **Systemic Admissibility Atlas** is a structured, cross-domain reference that
maps **admissibility patterns**, **boundary conditions**, and **regime transitions**
observed in complex systems.

It is not a theory, model, or algorithm.
It is an interpretive atlas: a collection of canonical structures that help
identify *when* and *why* systems remain viable, degrade, or collapse under constraint.

---

## Purpose

The Atlas complements the canonical *Systemic Admissibility* framework by providing:

- A catalog of recurring admissibility patterns
- Cross-domain analogies between breakdowns and transitions
- A shared language for comparing systems with different substrates
- Conceptual guidance for diagnosis, not prediction or control

The Atlas is designed to support **analysis, interpretation, and comparative study**
across physics, biology, cognition, artificial intelligence, economics, and governance.

## What This Atlas Is

- A **conceptual map** of admissibility regimes  
- A **cross-domain reference** for boundary phenomena  
- A **non-operational** and **non-prescriptive** resource  
- A companion to meta-level admissibility frameworks  

---

## What This Atlas Is Not

- Not an executable or predictive model  
- Not an optimization or control system  
- Not a proposal of new physical laws  
- Not a replacement for domain-specific theories  

---

## Core Concept: Admissibility

Across domains, systems remain viable only when value generation does not exceed
the combined costs required to sustain the system.

Admissibility failures manifest as:
- Instability
- Inefficiency
- Pathological behavior
- Apparent paradoxes
- Regime breakdowns

The Atlas documents *how these failures appear*, not how to engineer around them.

This Atlas does not define admissibility.
It illustrates admissibility.

## Relationship to the Canonical Framework

This Atlas **does not define admissibility**.
It **illustrates admissibility**.

Formal definitions, axioms, and constraints belong in the canonical repository.
This Atlas provides:
- Examples
- Patterns
- Structural similarities
- Diagnostic insight

Think of it as a *map of territories*, not the law that governs them.

## Status

- Conceptual
- In expansion
- Open to disciplined contributions
- Intentionally conservative in claims
